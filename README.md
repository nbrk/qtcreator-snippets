# qtcreator-snippets
Some useful C/C++ code snippets for QtCreator backed up for my own convenience

- GObject object decls/defs (starts with "gobject_final")
- GObject interface decls/defs (starts with "gobject_iface")
- GObject object def implementing such an interface (starts with "gobject_iface_impl")

The snippets are stored in XML file:
~/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/snippets/snippets.xml
